# adventure-builder

Build an online choose-your-own-adventure book that let user choose between scenarios to advance in an epic adventure ( we should be able to add song link from youtube to be played in the background and the ability to add picture to the epic adventure . Make it so you can either play or build, if you play you enjoy the pre-directed scenario if you create you can edit at least 5 pages of choices with text and images


we should add a way for user to add their own scenarios, to do so we should give the user option to modify the text and to add a pictures, the screen should be divided in 2 equal parts, in this example " take the left path" and " take the right path" different pictures should come with the texts, that would help immersion. Add button in the top right corner that ask user if he want to be a player or to create a scenario, if he click on create a scenario he should be able to set at least 5 pages of choices ( in this case take the left and take the right path is 1 page, when you click on either left or right, you get on the second pages ( with 2 new texts and 2 new images ) etc.
